# 5. Write a Python program which iterates through the integers from 1 to 100. 

# 	For multiples of three print "Fizz" instead of the number. 
# 	For the multiples of five print "Buzz" instead of the number.
# 	For numbers which are multiples of both three and five print "FizzBuzz".
# 	Use continue statements to avoid printing both numbers and the words.
