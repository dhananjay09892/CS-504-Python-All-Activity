# 1.	Follow the steps of the pseudo code to create a program on Python.

# •	Create a variable, number1, and give it a value of 8.
# •	Create another variable, number2, and give it a value of 12.
# •	Add the two variables to create a third variable, number3.
# •	Add 6 to number 1 and 8 to number2.
# •	Multiply number1 and number2 and store the value in number3.
# •	Print each of the 3 variables with a message.

# Ex: ‘The value for number1 is 54’

number1 = 8
print("The value for Number1 is ",number1)
number2 = 12
print("The value for Number2 is ",number2)
number3 = number1 + number2
print("The value for Number3 is ",number3)
number1 += 6
print("The value for Number1 is ",number1)
number2 += 8
print("The value for Number2 is ",number2)
number3 = number1 * number2
print("The value for Number3 is ",number3)
