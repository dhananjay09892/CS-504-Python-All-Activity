CS-111 Intro Structured Programming
Activity 2 – Constants, Variables and Statements

1.	Follow the steps of the pseudo code to create a program on Python.

•	Create a variable, number1, and give it a value of 8.
•	Create another variable, number2, and give it a value of 12.
•	Add the two variables to create a third variable, number3.
•	Add 6 to number 1 and 8 to number2.
•	Multiply number1 and number2 and store the value in number3.
•	Print each of the 3 variables with a message.

Ex: ‘The value for number1 is 54’

2.	Write a program to find the average grade of four subjects; geography, history, math and science.

•	Ask the user to enter the marks for each of the courses. 
•	Calculate the average grade.
•	Print out the result with a message.


3.	Write a program to accept radius of circle and display its area and circumference.

•	Create a PInumber variable and give it a value of 3.
•	Ask the user for the radius of the circle.
•	Print out the circumference and the area of the circle with a message.

“The circumference of the circle is … and its area is ….”

Circumference of a circle = 2πr
Area of circle = πr²



4.	Write a program to calculate the total amount the user needs to pay for some oranges and bananas.

•	Decide on the price of each of these items.
•	Ask the user how many of each item he/she bought.
•	Calculate the final amount they need to pay and print it with a message.

The total amount you need to pay is 48 dollars.


5.	Write a program to calculate the monthly pay of an employee. Get the input for the following and print out the monthly salary with a message.  

•	How many hours the employee works a day.
•	How many days the employee works in a week.
•	Create a rate variable and give it a value of 20 dollars.

Your monthly salary is 1500 dollars.


6.	Write a program to calculate the check at a restaurant. 

•	The items on the menu have the following prices; 
o	Individual pizzas $10
o	Soft drinks $2
o	Desserts $5. 
•	Calculate the check for a party of 3 who had 1 of each item.
•	Calculate the tax amount to be added to the bill (7 percent sales tax).
•	Calculate the tip (18 percent).
•	Calculate the total bill and display all the information in the following format.

HINT: You can use the round function to round up the tax and tip if necessary. You can also limit the number of decimal points to two.

o	round(tax, 2)



Meal: $.....
Tax: $.....
Tip: $.....
Total Bill: $.....
