# 7. Create the code for a guessing game.

# 	Import the random module to use random.randint() method which gives us a random integer.
# 	Have the user input for low and high limits for the random number. The syntax to specify a range for the random.randint() method is random.randint(x, y)
# 	Let the user know that they have only 10 chances to guess correctly!
# 	Create a while loop to get the guesses from the user and keep track of the number of guesses.
# 	Put a conditional statement to check whether the guess is right. Print out a message if it is and in how many tries.
# 	Add more conditional statements to inform the user whether his/her guess is higher or lower than the random number it the guess is not right.
# 	If the user exceeds 10 chances, inform them about the situation, give the correct answer, and wish them good luck next time.
